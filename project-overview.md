# Project Overview

Project Name: Mock Smart Home Security & Monitoring App

Description: A mobile application (frontend only!) that *simulates* control and monitoring of smart home security and water tank systems. Users can view motion detection status, control security lights, trigger alarms, and monitor water tank levels. All data and controls are mocked on the frontend.

Features:
*   Mock Security System Status: Display simulated motion detection alerts.
*   Mock Light Control:  Toggle simulated security lights on and off.
*   Mock Alarm System:  Trigger a simulated alarm.
*   Mock Water Tank Monitoring:  Display the water tank level and allow simulated control of a water pump or valve.

Technology Stack:
*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
